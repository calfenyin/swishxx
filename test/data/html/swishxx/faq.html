      There are none available from the SWISH++ home page intentionally
      because certain parameters need to be configured
      on a per-machine basis for optimal performance.
      However, some Linux vendors may choose to build a SWISH++ package
      and include it in their distibutions.
      Check with your Linux vendor.
      (Such packages are usually several versions old,
      so you really should just build SWISH++ from source.)

      Chances are the answer is &quot;no.&quot;
      The documentation is complete.
      If it doesn't say anything about a feature you want,
      then odds are that SWISH++ doesn't do it.
      (Documentation should describe the finite number of things
      a software package does,
      not the infinite number of things it doesn't do.)

      </font>
      <br />
      First, a simple fact:
      indexing takes a lot of memory.
      Period.  Full stop.  No two ways about it.  End of story.
      You can't expect to be able to index, say, the Library of Congress
      on a machine with 64MB.
      Second, you need to read the documentation,
      specifically for the <tt>TempDirectory_Default</tt>
      and <tt>Word_Threshold</tt> configuration parameters
      in the <tt>config.h</tt> file and make adjustments for your system.
      Lastly, if all else fails, get more memory.

      Not as-is.
      The set of stop-words, the word-determination heuristics,
      and the stemming algorithm would have to be changed.
      <b>
        Using SWISH++ as-is to index documents
        in a language other than English is naive
        and will yield poor results.

      </font>
      <br />
      This has the same answer as FAQ #4.
      Additionally,
      an index/search application like SWISH++ isn't generally useful
      for source code.
      When you search source code,
      you typically want to find <i>every</i> occurrence of an identifier,
      so giving search results in ranked order isn't necessary or useful.
      Use <tt>grep</tt>(1) recursively instead.
