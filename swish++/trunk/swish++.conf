#	SWISH++
#	swish++.conf
#
#	This is a template configuration file.  It contains every
#	configuration variable, lists which executable(s) it's used with, and
#	gives a brief explanation.  Use this as a starting point for your own
#	configuration file.
#
#	Notes:
#	------
#
#	1. Sets of values are separated by whitespace.
#
#	2. The same variable may be specified on more than one line.  For sets,
#	   the value is the union of all the values; for all others, the value
#	   is the last value specified.
#
#	3. There is a special "infinity" numeric value.
#
#	4. Boolean values are one of: true, t, false, f, yes, y, no, n.  Case
#	   is irrelevant.
#
#	5. COMMENTS ARE TREATED AS SUCH ONLY IF THEY ARE ON LINES BY
#	   THEMSELVES!
##

#ExcludeClass		no_index
#
# used by: index; same as the -C option.
#
#	For HTML or XHTML files only, a set of class names of HTML or XHTML
#	elements whose content text is not to be indexed.

ExtractExtension	txt
#
# used by extract; same as the -x option.
#
#	The extension to append to filenames during extraction.

ExtractFilter		no
#
# used by extract; when "yes", same as the -f option.
#
#	When "yes", extract a single file to standard output.

HTMLFile		*.asp *.*htm* *.jsp
#
# used by: index; same as the -h option.
#
#	A set of filename patterns of HTML files to index.  Case is
#	significant.  Files specified here MUST NOT also be specified in
#	IncludeFile below.
#
#	You should modify the set to include only those that you are actually
#	using for increased performance.

IncludeFile	*.txt
#ExcludeFile	*.gif *.jpg
#
# used by: index, extract; same as the -e or -E option, respectively.
#
#	A set of filename patterns of files to index or not to index,
#	respectively.  Case is significant.  You normally specify either
#	IncludeFile or ExcludeFile (whichever is easier to specify), but not
#	both.

#IncludeMeta		meta1 meta2 metaN
#ExcludeMeta		meta8 meta9 metaM
#
# used by: index; same as the -m or -M option, respectively
#
#	For HTML or XHTML files only, the value of meta NAME attributes for
#	which the words in the value of the associated CONTENT attribute should
#	be indexed or not indexed, respectively.  Case is irrelevant.  You
#	normally specify either IncludeMeta or ExcludeMeta (whichever is easier
#	to specify), but not both.
#	
#	By default, for IncludeMeta, words in the value of the CONTENT
#	attribute for all meta names are indexed.  Specifying at least one
#	meta name via IncludeMeta changes that so that only the words in the
#	value of the CONTENT attribute associated with a member of the set of
#	meta names explicitly specified are indexed.

Incremental		no
#
# used by: index; when "yes", same as the -I option.
#
#	When "yes", incrementally index files and add them to an existing
#	index.

FilesGrow		100
#
# used by: index; same as the -G option.
#
#	Default number of files to grow reserved space for when incrementally
#	indexing.

FilesReserve		1000
#
# used by: index; same as the -F option.
#
#	The initial number of files to reserve space for.  During indexing,
#	this can be exceeded without any problem, but there will be a slight
#	performance penalty.
#
#	If you know approximately how many files you have, modify the above
#	value!

#FilterFile *.gz		gunzip -c %f > @F
#FilterFile *.Z		uncompress -c %f > @F
#FilterFile *.pdf	pdftotext %f @F.txt
#
# used by: index, extract; no option equivalent.
#
#	Filter files having certain extensions prior to either indexing or
#	extraction.

IndexFile		swish++.index
#
# used by: index, search; same as the -i option.
#
#	The name of the index file either generated or searched.
#

#PidFile			/tmp/search.pid
#
# used by: search; same as the -P option
#
#	If "search" is run as a daemon, record its process ID in this file.

RecurseSubdirs		yes
#
# used by: index, extract; when "no", same as the -r option.
#
#	When "no", do not recursively index the files in subdirectories, that
#	is: when a directory is encountered, all the files in that directory
#	are indexed (modulo the filename extensions specified via the HTMLFile,
#	IncludeFile, or ExcludeFile variables), but subdirectories encountered
#	are ignored and therefore the files contained in them are not indexed.
#	(This variable is most useful when specifying the directories and files
#	via standard input.)  The default is to index the files in
#	subdirectories recursively.

ResultsMax		100
#
# used by: search; same as the -m option.
#
#	The maximum number of results to return overriding the compiled-in
#	default (which is usually 100).

#SearchDaemon		no
#
# used by: search; when "yes", same as the -b option.
#
#	Run "search" in the background as a daemon proess listening to a Unix
#	domain socket for requests.

#SocketFile		/tmp/search.socket
#
# used by: search; same as the -u option.
#
#	Default name of the Unix domain socket file; used only when
#	SearchDaemon is "yes".

#SocketQueueSize		100
#
# used by: search; same as the -q option.
#
#	Maximum number of queued connections for a socket; used only when
#	SearchDaemon is "yes".

#ThreadsMin		5
#ThreadsMax		100
#
# used by: search; same as the -t or -T option, respectively.
#
#	The minimum/maximum number of simultanous threads, respectively; used
#	only when SearchDaemon is "yes".

StemWords		no
#
# used by: search; when "yes", same as the -s option.
#
#	Perform stemming (suffix stripping) on words during searches.  Words
#	that end in the wildcard character are not stemmed.

#StopWordFile		custom_stop_word_file
#
# used by: index, extract; same as the -s option.
#
#	The name of a file containing the set of stop-words to use instead of
#	the built-in set.

#TempDirectory		/tmp
#
# used by: index
#
#	Directory to use for temporary files during indexing.  If your OS
#	mounts swap space on /tmp, as indexing progresses and more files get
#	created in /tmp, you will have less swap space, indexing will get
#	slower, and you may run out of memory.  If this is the case, you can
#	specify a directory on a real filesystem, i.e., one on a physical
#	disk.  The directory must exist.

TitleLines		12
#
# used by: index; same as the -t option.
#
#	For HTML or XHTML files only, the maximum number of lines into a file
#	to look at for HTML or XHTML <TITLE> tags.  The default is 12.  Larger
#	numbers slow indexing.

Verbosity		0
#
# used by: index, extract; same as the -v option.
#
#	Print additional information to standard output during indexing.  The
#	verbosity levels, 0-4; see index(1) or extract(1) for details.

WordFilesMax		infinity
#
# used by: index, search; same as the -f option.
#
#	The maximum number of files a word may occur in before it is discarded
#	as being too frequent.  The default is infinity.

WordPercentMax		100
#
# used by: index, search; same as the -p option.
#
#	The maximum percentage of files a word may occur in before it is
#	discarded as being too frequent.  If you want to keep all words
#	regardless, specify 101.

# the end
