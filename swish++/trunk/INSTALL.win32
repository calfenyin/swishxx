Prerequisites for Building SWISH++ for Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT
===============================================================================

	Note: precompiled Win32 executables are available on the
	SWISH++ web site.

SWISH++ has the following software as prerequisites:

1. The MinGW software.  This is a collection of files, libraries, a C++
   compiler, and tools needed to compile SWISH++ under Windows.  It is
   available from:

	http://mingw.sourceforge.net/

2. Perl 5 (or later), but only if you intend on using either httpindex,
   searchc, or WWW.pm.  A free binary distribution is available from:

	http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/

3. The GNU wget command, but only if you intend on using httpindex.  A free
   binary distribution is available from:

	http://www.qtm.net/~twegscheid/wget.html

Building SWISH++ for Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT
===============================================================================

	Note: the multi-threaded daemon server feature of search(1) is
	currently NOT supported under Windows, nor will it be until
	somebody familiar with multi-threaded programming under Windows
	volunteers to port it.

	Note: extract(1) is not supported as of this release.

1. Edit the "config.h" file to your liking.  This file controls how the
   software runs.  You REALLY need to understand and properly set 
   Word_Threshold.  Improperly set, SWISH++ can take hours to index whereas
   it should only take minutes.  Once you understand them, comment out the
   #error lines.  (The #error lines are there intentionally to force you to
   edit the file.)

2. Go to the "config" directory and edit the "config.mk" file as necessary.
   This file controls how the software is compiled.

3. Go back to the top-level directory and type:

	make -f Win32-Makefile-index.v
	make -f Win32-Makefile-search.v

   If everything works out, the software will be built.

Notes
===============================================================================

1. Don't complain to me or bother asking me for help if you get either "No such
   file or directory" for or errors in the standard C++ headers.  It means that
   your C++ compiler and/or libraries are improperly installed.  I know nothing
   about your OS or how your system is (mis)configured.  Complain to your
   sysadmin: the person who botched the installation and whose job it is to fix
   it.

2. Don't ask me questions like, "Can SWISH++ do this?"  The documentation
   describing SWISH++ is complete.  If you read the documentation and what you
   are looking for is not there, then SWISH++ doesn't do it.
