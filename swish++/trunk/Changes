*******************************************************************************
5.3.6
*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* When compiling using g++, added additional compiler options to reduce code
  size and slightly improve performance.

  (This feature shall be known as feature GPPO.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* Indexing files via standard input where the order of the directories
  wasn't "monotonically increasing," didn't work: files ended up in the wrong
  directory.

  As a beneficial consequence, the -D and -G options and the DirectoriesGrow
  and DirectoriesReserve variables are no longer needed.

  (This bug fix shall be known as big fix ISI2.)

* Destroying a thread_pool's threads didn't work properly in that the clean-up
  function for all threads didn't get called.  (This didn't matter for SWISH++
  since search(1) never destroys its thread_pool.)

  (This bug fix shall be known as big fix TPD.)

*******************************************************************************
5.3.5
*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* The code for modules has been reorganized into subdirectories that build
  libraries with the goal of having a completely modular indexing architecture
  similar to the way Apache has modules.  This is a work-in-progress.


BUG FIXES
---------

* Version 5.1 broke indexing file names via standard input.  D'oh!

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix FSI.)

* Version 5.1 also added unnecessary work for extract(1).

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix ESI.)

* The thread::~thread() destructor mistakenly killed the calling thread rather
  than itself.  Oops.  This didn't actually matter for SWISH++ since it's never
  called.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix TPTD.)

*******************************************************************************
5.3.4
*******************************************************************************

BUG FIXES
---------

* File titles turned to garbage when indexing file incrementally.

  (This bug fix shall be known as IIT.)

* option_stream's test main() was incorrectly defined inside the PJL namespace.

  (This bug fix shall be know as bug fix OSM.)

* option_stream didn't report an error for an option that required an argument
  when no argument was given when said option was the last thing on the commend
  line.

  (This bug fix shall be know as bug fix OSN.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* index.c

	1. Merged parse_file_info() function into load_old_index().
	2. In (what is now) load_old_index(), added a strdup() for the file's
	   title for bug fix IIT.

*******************************************************************************
5.3.3
*******************************************************************************

BUG FIXES
---------

* SIGPIPE wasn't handled at all so a search client that disconnected
  unexpectedly could crash the server.  Now that this has been fixed, the
  server also needs to check the state of the outgoing stream during writes for
  an error: if an error occurs, assume the client disconnected from the socket
  and stop sending output.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix PIPE.)

* On Linux systems, multiple reads from the search daemon timed out sooner than
  requested because Linux modifies the timeval struct passed to select() to
  reflect the amount of time not slept.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix LMR.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* search.c

	1. In main(), s/search_options opt/search_options const opt/
	2. In dump_single_word(), dump_word_window(), several places in
	   search() and service_request, added a check for the state of the
	   "out" stream for bug fix PIPE.

	1. Added set_signal_handlers() for bug fix PIPE.

* search_thread.c

	1. In search_thread::main():
		s/search_options opt/search_options const opt/
	2. In timed_read_line(), reworked the timeout such that the timeval
	   struct is always initialized properly for every loop iteration for
	   bug fix LMR.

* version.h

	1. Changed version to "5.3.3".


*******************************************************************************
5.3.2
*******************************************************************************

BUG FIXES
---------

* On some platforms, index(1) would index "0 words" for every file.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix IZW.)

* There was a race condition in the search daemon thread pool code whereby the
  prototype thread could begin executing before its owning thread_pool was
  fully constructed.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix TPR.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* encoded_char.h

	1. Made encoded_char_range::const_iterator's ch_ and decode() compile
	   in only when MOD_MAIL is defined for bug fix IZW.

	   of run_lock_ for bug fix TPR.
	3. In thread_pool::thread::~thread(), added destruction of run_lock_
	   for bug fix TPR.
	4. Changed thread_pool::thread_pool() to take a pointer to non-const
	   thread for bug fix TPR.
	5. In thread_pool::thread_pool(), made use of Exit_No_Init_Condition
	   and Exit_No_Init_Mutex.
	6. In thread_pool::thread_pool(), added prototype thread to pool and
	   now creating thread_min - 1 additional threads.
	7. In thread_pool::thread_pool(), s/create/create_and_run()/ for bug
	   fix TPR.
	8. In thread_pool::new_task(), s/create/create_and_run()/ for bug fix
	   TPR.

* thread_pool.h

	1. Added thread_pool::thread::run_lock_ for bug fix TPR.
	2. Added thread_pool::thread::run() and create_and_run() for bug fix
	   TPR.
	3. Changed thread_pool::thread_pool() to take a pointer to non-const
	   thread for bug fix TPR.

*******************************************************************************
5.3.1
*******************************************************************************

BUG FIXES
---------

* Searching with more that two "and" terms caused a core cump.  This bug was a
  result of the "enhancement" to doing multiple "and" terms in 5.3.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix MAT.)

* Compiling with all but the text module produced a syntax error.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix NMS.)

* version.h

	1. Changed version to "5.3.1".


*******************************************************************************
5.3
*******************************************************************************

BUG FIXES
---------

* The weighting of multiple "and" terms has been fixed.  Previously, the query:

	mouse and computer and keyboard

  was parsed and treated as:

	(mouse and computer) and keyboard
	  25%         25%           50%

  The problem was that the last term always got 50% of the weighting and the
  rest got 50% divided by the number of terms minus 1.

  In order to weight all the terms equally, the "and" results for each term are
  now saved in a list and then and'ed together at the end.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix MAW.)

* The index(1) manual page didn't explicitly state that words are converted to
  lower case prior to indexing.

5.0.1
*******************************************************************************

BUG FIXES
---------

* This releases fixes a lot of compile issues (mostly namespaces) with g++ 3.0.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix GCC3.)

* The changes to fix the above have apparantly caused bugs in (at least) g++
  2.95.3 to manifest themselves:

	1. In some cases, the compiler "forgets" that operator<<(
	   ostream&, string const& ) has been defined.  The hack
	   workaround is to use operator<<( ostream&, char const* ) and
	   use string::c_str().

	2. The compiler "forgets" that stream manipulators have been defined.
	   The workaround is not to use them.  :-(

  (This fix shall be known as fix OOS.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* bcd.h

	1. Switched to using local omanip since depending on the
	   underlying C++ implementation is not portable.  This was

*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* The indexing code has bee rearchitected to be modular allowing for new file
  formats to be indexed directly (without filters).  Consequently, the indexing
  of HTML files has been turned into a module.

  The -e option and IncludeFile variable are now INCOMPATIBLE with previous
  releases.  Read the updated documentation.

  (This feature shall be known as feature MOD.)

* A filter module for mail (and news) files has been added.

  (This feature shall be known as feature MAIL.)

* A filter module for manual page files has been added.

  (This feature shall be known as feature MAN.)

* For index, a new -A or --no-assoc-meta option and AssociateMeta configuration
  variable have been added.

  (This feature shall be known as feature AMN.)

* There is a new %E (second-to-last filename extenstion) substitution.

  (This feature shall be known as feature 22L.)

* FilterFile configuration lines are now different and INCOMPATIBLE with
  previous releases.  The @ character no longer does substitutions but merely
  marks the target filename.  This was done to enable filtering to files having
  a fixed name to be able to handle filenames with spaces better.

  (This feature shall be known as feature SM2.)

* The search daemon can now answer queries via TCP sockets in addition to Unix
  domain sockets.

  (This feature shall be known as feature TCP.)

* You can now specify the separator character in search results.

  (This feature shall be known as feature SRS.)

* Added parsing of XHTML 1.1 ruby elements.

  (This feature shall be known as feature RUBY.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* The index(1) -T option was ignored.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix ITO.)

* A configuration file that did not end in a newline would cause a segfault.
  (I think: I never tried it, but it looked like a bug to me.)

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix CNL.)

* Configuration error messages output "(null)" (or seg-faulted) for the
  variable name.  I don't see how the compiler didn't catch this since the
  name_ data member is const and therefore must be initialized in the
  constructor.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix NVR.)

* Setting the SearchDaemon config. variable to Y didn't allow no command-line
  arguments to be given.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix DCL.)

* Filter substitution incorrectly rescanned substituted text.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix FSR.)

* Several tweaks were made to make SWISH++ compiled under FreeBSD.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix BSD3.)

* Added -lnsl for compiling the search daemon under Solaris.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix SOL2.)

* Removed some more buffer-overflow bugs.

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix BOB.)

* Filename patterns didn't match if the wildcard wasn't first, e.g., foo*

  (This bug fix shall be known as bug fix WWF.)

*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* The filename pattern matching (FNP) feature introduced in 4.5 has finally
  been ported to Windows.

  (This feature shall be known as feature WFNP.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* The GNUmakefile didn't build dependencies properly for files that are
  conditionally #include'd.

  (This bug fix shall be knows as bug fix IDB.)

* The directory separator character ('/' for Unix) is apparantly transformed
  into '\' for Windows by the intermediate Windows port of POSIX functions.
  However, in the case where '/' is inserted into a string and that string is
  printed, the mere printing won't do the transformation.

  (This bug fix shall be knows as bug fix WDSC.)

NEW FEATURES
------------

* Added 'b' and 'B' substitutions for filters that are the base name and base
  name minus the extension of a file name, respectively.  This is useful when
  you need the temporary files created in a location other than where the
  originals are, for example when the originals are on a filesystem that you
  don't have write access to.

  Note that, for consistency, the 'E' substitution has been renamed to 'F'.
  This is therefore an incompatible change with previous versions of SWISH++.

	2. Same as extract.c item #2.

	3. In main() for the 'C', 'm', and 'M' command-line options
	   cases, removed unnecessary strdup() since the variables are
	   derived from conf_set that is-a string_set that uses
	   std::string so the strings are copied anyway.

	4. In load_old_index(), removed unnecessary strdup() for
	   similar reason to item 3.

	5. In index_word(), performed following substitution:

		s/if ( exclude_class_count )/if ( exclude_class_count > 0 )/

	   just because it seemed "more correct."

	6. Corresponding change as index.h item #1.

	7. In index_words(), removed "static bool new_file" variable
	   for bug fix ECC.

	8. In index_words(), added:

NEW FEATURES
------------

* The FilterExtension variable now allows you to specify literal % and @
  characters by simply doubling the character.

  expand because the while loop exited prematurely.  (This didn't currently
  matter, but it might in the future.)

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix CEV.)

* Fixed a bug in install-sh whereby source files in subdirectories would not
  be chown'd and chmod'd properly.  (This didn't matter for SWISH++ the way
  it's distributed, but it might in the future.)

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix ISD.)


CHANGES, file-by-file

*******************************************************************************
4.3.1
*******************************************************************************

BUG FIXES
---------

* Indexing via standard input did NOT index all files: it still required you to
  specify extensions via -e.  This is totally wrong.  It seems it's been wrong
  since version 3.1.  I'm surprised nobody noticed.

  (This bug fix will be know as bug fix SII.)

* Fixed build problem on Debian Linux systems having to do with the type of the
  3rd argument to accept(3).

		s/exclude_extensions.empty()/!include_extensions.empty()/

	   for bug fix SII.

	   will get built first since it is #include'd by most other
	   files.

------------

* 'search' has a new -P (or --pid-file) option and PidFile configuration
  variable to specify a file to write its process ID when running as a daemon.

  (This feature will be known as feature PID.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* The FilesGrow feature was broken because I forgot a needed set of parentheses
  to get the precedence right.  :-(

  (This bug will be known as bug fix FGP.)

* For 'search', the description of the -p and --word-percent option in the
  usage message wasn't printed unless it was compiled as a daemon (and these
  options have nothing to do with it being a daemon).

*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* Generated index files are now approximately 24% smaller.

  (This feature will be known as feature SIF.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* When index(1) generated partial indicies, it never removed words that
  occurred in more files than the allowable percentage.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix PIR.)

* The -T/--temp-dir options were left out of the option specification for
  index(1) so you could never specify these options on the command line.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix TDO.)

* Added a call to setsid() for becomming a search daemon.  It should have been
  there all along.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix SID.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* bcd.c
* bcd.h

	1. Added these files for feature SIF.

* config.h

	1. Added #error directives to force people to read config.h and
	   set important values for their system.

* exit_codes.h

	1. Added Exit_No_Unlink.

* file_list.c

	1. Rewrote file_list::calc_size() for bug fix PIR.  I was
	   counting spaces.  Why?  I don't know.  There were never any
	   spaces in the file list data.  As far as I can tell, this
	   never worked.

	2. Rewrote file_list::const_iterator::operator++() to parse
	   index file word data in new format for feature SIF.

* file_list.h

	1. Performed following substitution:

		s/ptr/ptr_/

	2. Performed following substitution:

		s/char const/unsigned char const/

	   for feature SIF since we now have to deal with byte values
	   greater than 0x7F.

* index.c

	1. In merge_indicies() and write_word_index(), changed the
	   format in which the index file is written from ASCII to BCD
	   for feature SIF.

	2. It seems as though the merge_indicies() code was slightly
	   broken.  While it appeared to merge properly, I don't think
	   it ever threw out words that exceeded any thresholds.  I
	   rewrote chunks of it for bug fix PIR.

	3. Factored out some code into a new is_too_frequent() function.

	4. In write_meta_name_index(), changed the ASCII numerical
	   output to BCD for feature SIF.

	5. In write_full_index(), changed the comment describing the
	   format of the index file for feature SIF.

	1. Updated version to "4.1".

* word_info.c

	1. Added this file to factor out the code for writing META IDs.

* word_info.h

	1. Added write_meta_ids() function declaration.

	   daemon.

	9. In usage() added description for new options for feature MSD.

* managed_ptr.h
* SearchDaemon.h
* search_thread.c

* In 'search', allow max-results to be specified as 0.  This allows the -R
  option to be eliminated.

  (This feature will be known as feature MR0.)

* Added code to max-out various resource limits since SWISH++ is resource-
  intensive.  This may alleviate out-of-memory conditions on some platforms.

  (This feature will be known as feature MAXR.)

* Added code to map ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1) characters to their closest ASCII
  equivalent so that they are treated eactly like character entity references.
  This should also improve use of SWISH++ in other languages.

  (This feature will be known as feature ISOMAP.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* Feature CLASS has had a subtle bug in it since its inception in version 2.0.
  It was over-zealous in closing HTML elements.  For example, given:

	<TABLE>
	    <TR>			<!-- 2 -->
	        <TD>			<!-- 1 -->
	            <TABLE>		<!-- 0 -->
	                <TR>
	                    <TD>
	                    Hello
	                    </TD>
	            </TABLE>		<!-- trouble -->
	        </TD>
	</TABLE>

  The "trouble" tag should have stopped closing elements at tag "0" but it kept
  closing elements "1" and "2" because </TD> and </TR> have </TABLE> in their
  set of close tags.

  The fix is to make a tag check to see whether the element it's closing is its
  own start tag: if so, stop.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix CLASS1.)

* Really long start tags, those with lots of attributes, exceeding 128
  characters, would cuase a buffer overflow and, occasionally, a core dump.
  The fix is to change the way getting the name of tags is done.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix RLST.)

*******************************************************************************
3.0.3
*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* A -H option has been added to 'index' to dump the built-in set of recognized
  HTML elements to standard output (so you can check to see if a certain tag is
  recognized or not).

  (This feature will be known as feature OPTH.)

* Boolean configuration file variables now accept "on" and "off" values.

  (This feature will be known as feature ON_OFF.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* There was a small memory leak when indexing META names.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix ML1.)

* Reporting errors in a configuration file says what line number the error is
  on.  However, the same error-reporting code is also used to print errors when
  command-line arguments are invalid.  The line number variable wasn't cleared
  so it would print an erroneous line number for an invalid command-line
  option.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix CLN.)

* Parsing of Boolean values in configuration files was completely broken.

  (This bug fix will be know as bug fix PBV.)

* WWW::extract_description() did it wrong for ALT attributes with an empty
  value, i.e., ALT="".

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix ADE.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* conf_bool.c

	1. In parse_value(), added code to accept "on" and "off" for
	   feature ON_OFF.

	2. In parse_value(), added '!' characters before ::strcmp()
	   calls for bug fix PBV.

* conf_bool.h
* conf_int.h

	1. Performed following substitution:

		s/string/std::string/

* FilterExtension.c

	1. Performed following substitution:

	3. In parse_html_tag(), corresponding change to elements.c #1.

	4. In parse_html_tag(), changed the way META names are looked
	   up for bug fix ML1.  Specifically, we no longer
	   unconditionally do a strdup(): this was the source of the
	   memory leak.

* index.c

	1. Added #include "elements.h" for feature OPTH.

	2. In main() and usage(), added code for feature OPTH.

	3. Corresponding change to my_set.h #1.

	4. Corresponding change to extract.c #2.

* less.h

	1. Started using binary_function's first_argument_type,

		s/find/contains/

	   to distinguish it from STL find() functions that return
	   iterators.

* search.c

	1. Corresponding change to my_set.h #1.

	2. In usage(), removed "standard out" verbiage.

* stem_word.c

	1. In stem_word(), removed use of char_buffer_pool.

		$s =~ s/<[^>]+?ALT\s*=\s*(['"])([^>]+)\1[^>]*?>/$2/gi;
		$s =~ s/<[^>]+?ALT\s*=\s*(['"])([^'"]+)\1?\s*$/$2/i;
	   to:
		$s =~ s/<[^>]+?ALT\s*=\s*(['"])([^>]*?)\1[^>]*?>/$2/gi;
		$s =~ s/<[^>]+?ALT\s*=\s*(['"])([^'"]*)\1?\s*$/$2/i;

	   for bug fix ADE.


*******************************************************************************
3.0.2

*******************************************************************************
3.0.1
*******************************************************************************

BUG FIXES
---------

  previous versions of g++ allowed to compile.

  (This bug fix will be known as GCC2.95.)

* There were a few mistakes in the section 1 manual pages to cover all the
  changes to version 3.0.

  (This bug fix will be known as MAN3.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* elements.c

	1. On line 276, added an intermediate cast to int to get rid of
	   an error trying to convert directly from a char* to an enum
	   for bug fix GCC2.95.

	1. Added definitions for:

		word_index::const_iterator::operator+=()
		word_index::const_iterator::operator-=()

	   for bug fix GCC2.95.


*******************************************************************************
3.0
*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* SWISH++ now allows flexible file filtering for extraction and indexing.

  (This feature will be known as feature FFF.)

* SWISH++ now allows configuration files since they were necessary for feature
  FFF.  If I had to add them, I might as well do it right.

  (This feature will be known as feature CONF.)

* SWISH++ now compiles and runs under Windows (95/98/NT).

  (This feature will be known as feature WIN32.)

* 'index' now accepts a -T option that allows the directory to use for
  temporary files to be specified.

  (This feature will be known as feature TEMP.)

* 'index' and 'extract' now report the number of files examined in addition to
  the number indexed or extracted, respectively.

  (This feature will be known as feature EXAM.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* In the admitedly rare case of a malformed HTML file ending in a '<' character
  (without a newline, i.e., '<' is the *VERY* last character in the file),
  'index' would core-dump.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix EGT.)

	   confused with the .sh suffix and try to build it.

	2. Define PJL_NO_SYMBOLIC_LINKS if WIN32 is defined for feature
	   WIN32.

* config/Makefile

	1. Removed test for bool type: bool is now a requirement of the
	   C++ compiler.  This was necessary for feature CONF since it
	   specializes a template on bool.

	2. Performed following substitution:

		s/config.sh/config-sh/

	   corresponding to config/config-sh item #1.

	   it specializes a template on bool.

* file_index.h
* file_index.c

	1. Removed #include "fake_ansi.h" since bool is now required.

* file_list.c

	1. Added #include "fake_ansi.h".

* In all earlier versions, the number of total words reported was actually the
  total number of words indexed; now, it is the total number of words parsed
  and the former "total words" is now reported as the number of words indexed.

  (This feature will be known as feature NTW.)

* The 'search' command now outputs an additional comment "results" followed by
  the total number of search results.  Additionally, there is a new -R command-
  line option to print this alone.

*******************************************************************************
1.7
*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* Since version 1.4, SWISH++ indexed the text in the ALT attributes of AREA and
  IMG elements.  SWISH++ now adds a few attributes.  The complete set is:

	Attribute	Element
	---------	-------
	TITLE		any
	ALT		AREA, IMG, INPUT
	STANDBY		OBJECT
	SUMMARY		TABLE

  (This feature will be known as IEA.)

* Added Word_Min_Vowels to config.h so vowel checks can be disabled (or made
  more stringent).

  (This feature will be know as feature WMV.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* When a given word appeared through many files, its ranks came out rather
  "flat" in the search results.  This has been fixed.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix 10K.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* config.h

	1. Added Word_Min_Vowels definition for feature WMV.

	   It should have been there all along.

* html.c

	1. Added declarations for find_attribute(), skip_html_comment()
	   and skip_html_tag() to the top of the file.  They should
	   have been there all along.

		static chat_entity_map const char_entities;

	   It should have been there all along.

	3. Modified find_attribute() so that the 'begin' and 'end'
	   iterators are touched only if the attribute is found.

	4. Split out function skip_html_tag() from parse_html_tag()
	   because it's cleaner that way.

	5. In parse_html_tag(), was able to eliminate the
	   'parse_elements' parameter due to #4.

	6. In parse_html_tag(), added code for feature IEA.

* html.h

*******************************************************************************
1.6
*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* The value of the CONTENT attribute for META elements can now selectively be
  indexed based on the value of the NAME attribute, either by explicit
  inclusion or exclusion.

  (This feature will be known as feature MIE.)

* The WWW Perl library has a new function, extract_meta(), that can extract the
  value of the CONTENT attribute from a META element having a given NAME
  attribute from an HTML file.

  This can be used to display meta information in search results, e.g., for
  a given search result, also display its author, publication date, etc.

  (This feature will be known as feature EMC.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* If parentheses were used in conjunction with 'not' in a query involving meta
  names, it didn't work, e.g.:

	search author = not hawking

  worked as expected, but:

	search author = not ( hawking )

  didn't even though it is (supposed to be) equivalent.

	   parse_meta() and parse_query() functions for bug fix MNP.

	2. In parse_primary()'s lparen_token case, added "meta_id" to
	   recursive call of parse_query() for bug fix MNP.

	1. Added extract_meta() function for feature EMC.

	2. Rewrote extract_description() in terms of extract_meta().


*******************************************************************************
1.5.1
*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* Both 'index' and 'extract' now have a new verbosity level 4 that prints
  filenames that are not indexed or extracted, respectively, and why.  (This
  feature was added to help fix bug fix HTH.)

  (This feature will be known as feature IEV4.)

* The 'httpindex' script's -v option now works exactly like that of 'index'.

  (This feature will be known as feature HTV.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* META attribute name parsing had a bug where the find_attribute() function
  could occasionally run past the 'end' of where it was supposed to look.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix FAE.)

* The 'httpindex' script would hang if it told 'index' to index a file and,
  for whatever reason, 'index' couldn't since 'index' would silently skip the
  file.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix HTH.)

* The WWW::extract_description() function returned the first
  $description::chars characters of a file untouched if the file did not end
  with one of the filename extensions matched by the pattern
  /\.(?:[a-z]?html?|txt)$/i.  What it should do is return a null description.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix EDN.)

* The 'httpindex' script didn't test the extracted description to see if it is
  null: if it is, it should not attempt to overwrite the original file with the
  description and instead just delete the file.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix HTND.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* extract.c

	1. In main(), changed upper-bound for verbosity to 4 for
	   feature IEV4.

	   that don't match for bug fix FAE.

	2. In find_attribute(), made it so that 'c' is never
	   incremented past 'end' (as it sometimes incorrectly was) for
	   bug fix FAE.

* httpindex.in

	1. Performed following substitution:

		s/-v3/-v4/

	   for bug fix HTH.

	2. Added code to test the extracted description to see if it is
	   null for bug fix HTND.

	3. If a file can not be overwriten with its description (using
	   the -d option), a warning is now merely issued rather than
	   dieing as in version 1.5.

	4. Added code for feature HTV.

* index.c

	1. Same as extract.c #1.

	2. Same as extract.c #2.

	3. Same as extract.c #3.

* man/man1/extract.1
* man/man1/index.1

  remote servers.

  (This feature will be known as feature HTTP.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* The regular expressions in extract_description() in WWW.pm had some bugs.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix WRE.)

* The ignore stop words feature (feature ISW) added in version 1.2 that was
  broken, fixed, and fixed again is being fixed yet again so that ignored words
  are reported even if there are no other results.

* index.c

	1. In do_file(), added a check to skip an empty file since
	   file_vector<T> now opens empty files for feature HTTP.

	2. Moved #include <dirent.h> after <sys/types.h> for BSD
	   systems.

* INSTALLATION

	1. A third prerequisite of Perl 5 was added for feature HTTP.

	2. A fourth prerequisite of wget was added for feature HTTP.

* Makefile

*******************************************************************************
1.4.1
*******************************************************************************

BUG FIXES
---------

* The META names words were associated with was completely wrong.  It worked in
  a small number of test cases (my original test cases -- figures), but not in
  the general case.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix MID.)

* In 1.4, a given word could be associated with at most 1 meta name per file.
  This limitation was an oversight.  It has been corrected.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix MMM.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* extract.c

	1. Performed following substitution:

		s/string_set.h/my_set.h/

* file_list.c

	1. Performed following substitution:

		s/meta_index/meta_id/

	   for bug fix MID.

	2. Added code to read multiple meta-IDs for bug fix MMM.

* file_list.h

	1. Changed declaration of file_list::value_type to be simply
	   word_info::file since the structures are the same.

	   viat atexit() so that temporary files are removed even if
	   the program terminates prematurely.

	4. In index_words(), added code to add multiple meta-IDs for
	   bug fix MMM.

	5. In merge_indices(), added code to write multiple meta-IDs
	   for bug fix MMM.

	   numeric ID for META name for bug fix MID.

	7. In write_word_index(), same as #4.

* index.h

	1. Same as file_list.c #1.

* less.h

	1. Added explicit default constructor since g++ 2.8.0 complains
	   if it isn't there and you try to define a "const less"
	   object.

* my_set.h

	1. This file was renamed from string_set.h.

	2. Made string_set class generic for any type T since we now
	   use a set< short > in word_info::file.

	3. Changed declaration of string_set to be simply:

		typedef my_set< char const* > string_set;

* postscript.h

	1. Same as extract.c #1.

* search.c

	1. Same as extract.c #1.

	2. Same as file_list.c #1.

	3. In dump_single_word(), performed following substitution:

		s/less< char const* >/less< char const* > const/

	   since it can be const (and everything that can be const
	   should be).

	4. In dump_word_window(), same as #3.

	5. Added get_meta_id() function for bug fix MID.

	6. In parse_meta(), performed following substitution:

		s/::distance( meta_names.begin(), found.first )
		 /get_meta_id( found.first )/
	
	   for bug fix MID.

	7. In parse_meta(), same as #3.

	8. In parse_primary(), same as #3.

	9. In parse_primary(), added code in while loop at end of
	   function to check all meta-IDs associated with a word for
	   bug fix MMM.

* stop_words.h

	1. Same as extract.c #1.

* string_set.h

	1. This file was renamed to my_set.h.  (See it for additional
	   changes.)

* version.h

	1. Updated version to "1.4.1".

* word_info.c

	1. Same as file_list.c #1.

* word_info.h

	1. Changed word_info::file struct to include a set of meta-IDs
	   for bug fix MMM.

	2. Changed word_info::file struct to use shorts for occurrences
	   and rank to conserve memory (since additional memory is now
	   being taken up by the set of meta-IDs).

	3. Gave the word_info::file struct 3 speparate constructors so
	   the minimal amount of code is executed depending on how an
	   object is constructed.

*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* SWISH++ now indexes and can search META data.

  (This feature will be known as feature META.)

* SWISH++ now indexes the words in ALT attributes within AREA and IMG elements.

  (This feature will be known as feature ALT.)

* SWISH++ can now index files and directories specified via standard input
  instead of via the command line.  When doing this, extensions of files to
  index need not explicitly be specified via the -e option, i.e., 'index'
  assumes you know what you're doing when specifying filenames.

  (This feature will be known as feature ISI.)

* For both 'index' and 'extract', a new -r command line option was added to
  suppress recursively indexing files in subdirectories.  This option is most
  useful in conjunction with the new ISI feature.

  (This feature will be known as feature CLR.)

* Added an optimization option for detemining whether a character is a "word
  character" by eliminating the call to strchr() in is_word_char().  This
  yields about a 10% performance improvement during indexing.

  (This feature will be known as feature WCO.)

* The code for the 'index' was profiled and a couple of performance tweaks were
  made yielding about a 7% performance improvement.

  (This feature will be known as feature PPT.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* A small bug whereby the last word of a file was not indexed if the last line
  didn't end in a newline (or a whitespace character in general) was fixed.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix ILW.)

	   parse_html_tag() to index the words in the CONTENT attribute
	   of META elements.

	   got tired of typing.)

	D. In rank_full_index(), moved the code to compute the ranks
	   AFTER the tests to see whether a word occurs too frequently.
	   It was originally placed before since file_count needed to
	   be calculated, but I realized this is known ahead of time as
	   simply info.files_.size().

	   option for feature META.

	4. In main(), used new enum for calls to
	   word_index::set_index_file().

	5. Replaced a lot of 'for' loops iterating over an entire
	   sequence with a new FOR_EACH or TRANSFORM_EACH macro.  (I
	   got tired of typing.)

	6. In dump_word_window(), added missing description for 'match'
	   parameter.

	7. In parse_query(), performed following substitution:

		s/parse_primary/parse_meta/

	   for feature META.

	8. Added parse_meta() function for feature META.

	9. In parse_primary(), added meta_index parameter for feature
	   META.

	A. In parse_primary(), added code to add words to result only

	   and added 'if's for bug fix ILW.

* token.c

	1. Reworked token::hold() to accomodate more than one
	   put_back() in a row for feature META since parse_meta()
	   requires two look-ahead tokens.

	2. Added new case for the '=' token for feature META.

* token.h

	1. Added equal_token for feature META.

	2. Corresponding change to token.c item #1.

* util.c

*******************************************************************************
1.3.2
*******************************************************************************

BUG FIXES
---------

* The ignore stop words feature (feature ISW) added in version 1.2 was slightly
  broken in 1.2.1; it was "fixed" in 1.2.2 (bug fix ISW2), but not quite in
  that if left hand side of a query was ignored, thw whole thing was.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix ISW3.)

* In 'index', the check for whether filename extensions were supplied was too
  early in the code so the -S option didn't work.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix CFE.)

* config/man.mk

	1. Made "make dist" make the manual pages in PDF format in
	   addition to text format.

* index.c

	1. Relocated code to check whether filename extensions were
	   supplied for bug fix CFE.

	2. In main(), used an ostream_iterator() to dump stop words.

	3. In do_file(), split tests for stop-words into two separate
	   'if' statements so to_lower() isn't called unless absolutely
	   necessary.

* search.c

	1. In parse_query(), redid ignore-handling code for bug fix
	   ISW3.

	2. In main(), used an ostream_iterator() to dump stop words.

	   millions, ninteen, second, seconds, seventeen, sixteen,
	   tens, third, thirteen, trillions.

* util.c

	1. In is_ok_word() on line 192, changed floating point
	   calculation to integer by multiplying LHS by 100 to increase
	   performance.

	2. On the same line, performed the followingg substitution:

		s/>=/>/

	   so the code matches the documentation that says, "...
	   contains more than a third capital letters ..."

* version.h

	1. Updated version to "1.3.2".

* www_example/search.cgi

	1. Removed extraneous 'o' (optimize) options from regular
	   expressions.

	   expressions.


*******************************************************************************
1.3.1
*******************************************************************************

BUG FIXES
---------

* Unbeknownst to me, I introduced a bug in 1.2.2 that broke wildcard searches.
  (Doh!)  This has been fixed.

  (This bug will will be known as bug fix WCF.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* man/man1/search.1

	1. Make it explicitly clear that wildcards are not permitted
	   for the -d and -w options.

* token.c

	1. Moved the line:

		::strcpy( t.lower_buf_, to_lower( t.buf_ ) );

	   before:

		if ( t.type_ )
			return in;

	   for bug fix WCF.

* version.h

	1. Updated version to "1.3.1".


*******************************************************************************
1.3
*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* In "search," a "window" of words can be dumped around the query words.

  (This feature will be known as feature DWW.)

* In "search," the -d option to dump the index for a word now dumps all the
  query words instead of a single word.  Additionally, a stop-word used to
  print "stop-word"; now it prints "# ignored: " followed by the word.

  (This feature will be known as feature DQW.)

* In "search," the -d option to dump the index for a word now prints the
  comment:

	# not found: word

  if 'word' is not found in the index.

  (This feature will be known as feature NFW.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* directory.c

	   for feature DQW.

	2. In main(), performed the following substitution:

		s/dDi:m:s:SV/dDi:m:s:SVw:/

	3. In main(), performed the following substitution:

		s/dump_entire_index || dump_stop_words || dump_word
		 /dump_entire_index || dump_stop_words/

	   for feature DQW since the -d option no longer takes an
	   argument.

	4. In main(), added code to handle new -w option for feature
	   DWW.

	5. In main(), added 'while' loop to code to dump multiple words
	   for feature DQW.

	6. In dump_single_word(), performed following substitution:

		s/"stop-word"/"# ignored: " << word/

	   for feature DQW.

	7. In dump_single_word(), added printing of new "not found"
	   comment key for feature NFW.

	8. Added function dump_word_window() for feature DWW.

	9. In usage(), performed following substitution:

		s/-d word/-d/

	   for feature DQW.

	A. In usage(), added text for new -w option for feature DWW.

* version.h

	1. Updated version to "1.3".


*******************************************************************************
1.2.2
*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* A heuristic was added not to index a word if it contains more than a
  threshold number of consecutive punctuation characters.

  (This feature will be known as feature MCP.)

* Files can now be indexed by exclusion of filename extensions rather than by
  inclusion via a new -E command-line option.

  (This feature will be known as feature EFE.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* The ignore stop words feature (feature ISW) added in version 1.2 was slightly
  broken in 1.2.1 in that the list of ignored words was no longer reported.

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix ISW2.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* config.h

	1. Performed following substitution:

		s/Word_Hex_Min_Size/Word_Hex_Max_Size/

	   The original name was inconsistent with the other parameters.

	2. Added "Word_Max_Consec_Puncts" for feature MCP.

* config.mk

	1. Performed following substitution:

		s/install.sh/install-sh/

	   so some versions of make don't get confused with the .sh
	   suffix and try to build it.

	1. Added definitions for WEXITSTATUS and WIFEXITED if not
	   defined on a particular system.

* extract.c

	1. Corresponding change for config.h item 1.

	   EFE.

	5. In do_file(), added check against new exclude_extensions
	   variable for feature EFE.

	   here for bug fix ISW2.

* token.c

	1. Changed token so that it is not converted to all lower-case
	   for bug fix ISW2.  Previously, acronyms were not recognized
	   in lower case and keywords ("and," "or," and "not") were not
	   recognized in upper case.

	2. Added code to make a copy of the token string in all lower
	   case.  This is still needed for stop-word determination.

*******************************************************************************
1.2.1
*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* In "search," the original -d option that used to dump the entire index now
  dumps the index entry for a single word.  Correspondingly, a new -D option
  now does what -d used to do.

  (This feature will be known as feature DSW.)

* In "search," the dump of the index entries now includes the rank.

  (This feature will be known as feature DIR.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* Numeric entity references were not converted to their ASCII equivalents.  (I
  don't know how I missed this.)

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix NER.)

* A search query that contained only stop-words returned all files (up to the
  specified limit or default maximum).

  (This bug fix will be known as bug fix RSW.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* config/config.mk

	1. Added comment at top to remind people that they must do a
	   "make distclean" before recompiling if they change any
	   definitions.

	2. Performed the following substitution:

		s!/usr/ucb/install!$(ROOT)/install.sh!

* entities.c

	1. Added num_entities[] for bug fix NER.

	2. Performed following substitutions:

		s/entity_map/char_entity_map/
		s/entity/char_entity/
		s/entity_name/name/

	   so as to distinguish them from the newly-added num_entities[].

	3. Added:

		"ETH", 'D', "eth", 'd',

	   to char_entity_table[].

* entities.h

	1. Added:

		extern char const num_entities[ 256 ];

	   for bug fix NER.

	2. Corresponding changes for entities.c item 2.

* html.c

	1. Corresponding changes for entities.c item 2.

	2. Made use of new num_entities[] for bug fix NER.

* index.c

	1. On line 400, performed the following substitution:

		s/*lower_word/*const lower_word/

	   It should have been that originally.

* install.sh

	1. Created this shell script to use for installs instead of
	   having to rely on the OS having a "Berkeley-esque" install
	   command.

* man/man1/search.1

	1. Changed description for feature DSW.

* search.c

	1. Added new find_result_type typedef.

	2. Added a new dump_single_word() function for feature DSW.

	3. Added "bool &ignore" parameter to parse_query() and
	   parse_primary() functions for bug fix RSW.

	4. Factored out code that determines whether a word was indexed
	   or not into a new function is_stop_word().

	5. In main(), added code for feature DSW.

	6. In main(), added code for feature DIR.

	7. In parse_query(), added code to ignore stop-words properly
	   for bug fix RSW.

	8. On line 423, performed following substitution:

		s/iterator/const_iterator/

	   It should have been that originally for "const correctness."

	9. In parse_primary(), made use of new is_stop_word() function
	   corresponding to item 4.

	A. In parse_primary(), added code under "not" case to check to
	   see whether the primary should be ignored for bug fix RSW.

	B. In usage(), added text to usage message for feature DSW.

* util.c

	1. On line 65, performed following substitution:

		s/STATIC_CAST/REINTERPRET_CAST/

	   It should have been that originally.

* version.h

* www_example/search.cgi

	1. Added "&'" characters to those that are not stripped from
	   the query.

	2. Added:

		next if /^#/;

	   so as to ignore comments we know nothing about that future
	   releases of SWISH++ may emit.

*******************************************************************************
1.2
*******************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES
------------

* SWISH++ now stores the list of stop-words in the generated index file so they
  can be ignored on searches later.  Previosuly, using a stop-word in a query
  would always yield 0 results since the stop-word isn't in the index.  After
  thinking about it, this is just plain stupid.

  (This feature will be referred to as feature ISW.)

* You can now specify the number of files to reserve space for on the command
  line for "index" overriding the default.

  (This feature will be referred to as feature ICF.)

* You can now specify the number of lines to look into a file for HTML <TITLE>
  tags on the command line for "index" overriding the default.

  (This feature will be referred to as feature ICt.)

* Added default values to usage messages.

  (This feature will be referred to as feature UDV.)


BUG FIXES
---------

* The detection of malformed queries was completely broken.  I don't see how
  this went undetected for this long.

  (This bug fix will be referred to as bug fix DMQ.)

* In the example WWW.pm Perl library, not all the "Unix-unfriendly" characters
  were stripped from filenames upon upload.

  (This bug fix will be referred to as bug fix UUC.)


CHANGES, file-by-file
---------------------

* config.h

	1. Performed following substitutions:

		s/Title_Lines/Title_Lines_Default/

	   for feature ICt.

	2. Performed following substitutions:

		s/Files_Default/Files_Reserve_Default/

	   for feature ICF.

	3. Added: Index_Filename_Default

* extract.c

	1. Added code to usage() for feature UDV.

	2. In do_file(), added code to check whether a word is a
	   stop-word explicitly for feature ISW.  This corresponds to
	   the change for util.c item 2.

* file_index.c

	1. Moved index file header parsing code into a new function
	   get_index_info() for feature ISW.

	2. Added: #include "util.h"

		extern int num_files_reserve;

	   for feature ICF.

	2. Performed following substitution:

		s/Files_Default/num_files_reserve/

	   for feature ICF.

* html.c

		extern int num_title_lines;

	   for feature ICt.

	2. Performed following substitution:

		s/Title_Lines/num_title_lines/

	3. Added:

		int num_title_lines = Title_Lines_Default;

	   for feature ICF.

	4. Performed following substitutions:

	6. Added 'F' option to command line parsing code and usage
	   message for feature ICF.

	7. Added 't' option to command line parsing code and usage
	   message for feature ICt.

	8. In do_file(), added code to check whether a word is a
	   stop-word explicitly for feature ISW.  This corresponds to
	   the change for util.c item 2.

	9. In merge_indices(), removed extra_stop_words and am now
	   using stop_words since they all have to be written to the
	   index file together.  This was done for feature ISW.

	A. In merge_indices(), added code to write additional header
	   information for the stop-words.

	B. In rank_full_index(), now add computed stop-words to global
	   set so they can all be written to the index file together.
	   This was done for feature ISW.

	C. In write_full_index(), added code to write additional header
	   information for the stop-words.

	D. Added code to usage() for feature UDV.

* Makefile

	1. Added new dependencies for feature ISW.

* man/man1/index.1

	1. Added description of new option for feature ICF.

	2. Added description of new option for feature ICt.

* man/man1/search.1

	1. Added description of comments "search" outputs for feature ISW.

	2. Added description of new -S option for feature ISW.

* man/man4/swish++.4

	1. Added description of new index file format for feature ISW.

* search.c

	1. Added definitions:

		word_index	stop_words;
		string_set	stop_words_found;

	   for feature ISW.

	2. Performed following substitution:

		s/"the.index"/Index_Filename_Default/

	3. In main(), added code for new -S option to dump the stop-
	   words from an index file.  This was done for feature ISW.

	4. In main(), added test of EOF for the query_stream to ensure
	   the entire query is parsed successfully for bug fix DMQ.

	5. In main(), added code to output stop-words ignored in the
	   query for feature ISW.

	6. In parse_query(), changed:

		if ( !parse_primary( query, temp1 ) )
			break;

	   to:

		if ( !parse_primary( query, temp1 ) )
			return false;

	   for bug fix DMQ.

	7. In parse_optional_relop(), changed code in default case by
	   adding a check for a ')' token for bug fix DMQ.

	8. In parse_primary(), added code to search stop-words for a
	   word in a query and ignore it for feature ISW.

	9. In parse_primary() for the lparen_token case, performed
	   following substitution:

		s/lparen_token/rparen_token/

	   for bug fix DMQ.

	A. Added code to usage() for feature UDV.

* stop_words.c

	1. Added "let's".

	   information of an index file for feature ISW.

	2. In is_ok_word(), removed check for stop-words for feature
	   ISW.  The calling code must now check for stop-words itself.
	   This was necessary because "search" checks for stop-words
	   differently than either "index" or "extract" does.

	3. Added function:

		char const *to_lower( char const *s )

	   for feature ISW.

	4. Added "missing":
	
		#include <cstring>

	2. Change corresponding to util.c item 2.

* version.h

	1. Added int parameter since a word_index is now used for both
	   the regular word index (0) and the new stop-word index (1).

	2. Moved index file header parsing code into a new function
	   get_index_info() in util.c for feature ISW.

* word_index.h

	1. Added int parameter to both constructor and set_file_index()
	   since a word_index is now used for both the regular word
	   index (0) and the new stop-word index (1).

* www_example/WWW.pm

	1. In parse_multipart(), added $'()*/\ characters to those
	   stripped from filenames for bug fix UUC.

* www_example/search.cgi
