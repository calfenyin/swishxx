.SH DESCRIPTION
The index file format used by SWISH++ is as shown above.
Every \f(CWword_offset\f1 is an offset into the
.I "word index"
pointing at the first character of a word entry;
similarly,
every \f(CWstop_word_offset\f1 is an offset into the
.I "stop-word index"
pointing at the first character of a stop-word entry;
similarly,
every \f(CWdirectory_offset\f1 is an offset into the
.I "directory index"
pointing at the first character of a directory entry;
similarly,
every \f(CWfile_offset\f1 is an offset into the
.I "file index"
pointing at the first byte of a file entry;
finally,
every \f(CWmeta_name_offset\f1 is an offset into the
.I "mete-name index"
pointing at the first character of a meta-name entry.
.PP
The index file is written as it is so that it can be mapped into memory via the
.BR mmap (2)
Unix system call enabling ``instantaneous'' access.
.SS BCD Integers
All integers in an index file are stored in BCD (binary coded decimal) format
for compactness.
A BCD integer that has an odd number of digits
is terminated by a low-order nybble with the value \f(CW\\xA\f1;
an integer that has an even number of digits
is terminated by a a byte with the value \f(CW\\xAA\f1.
(These values were chosen because they are invalid BCD.
All other values \f(CW\\xA0\f1 through \f(CW\\xFE\f1
are reserved for future use.)
.PP
For example, the integers 1\-9
are stored as single bytes of \f(CW\\x1A\f1\-\f(CW\\x9A\f1, respectively;
the integer 10 is stored as the two bytes of \f(CW\\x10AA\f1;
the integer 1967 is stored as the three bytes of \f(CW\\x1967AA\f1.
.PP
Since most integer values in an index file are less than 10000,
using BCD results in approximately a 25% storage reduction.
.SS Word Entries
Every word entry in the
.I "word index"
is of the form:
.cS
\f2word\fP0\f3\s+2{\s-2\fP\f2data\fP\f3\s+2}...\s-2\fPFF
.cE
that is: a null-terminated word followed by one or more
.I data
entries followed by an \f(CWFF\f1 byte where a
.I data
entry is:
.cS
\f3\s+2{\s-2\fP\f2I\fP\f3\s+2}[\s-2\fPEE\f3\s+2{\s-2\fP\f2M\fP\f3\s+2}...\s-2\fPEE\f3\s+2]{\s-2\fP\f2O\fP\f3\s+2}{\s-2\fP\f2R\fP\f3\s+2}\s-2\fP
.cE
that is: a file-index
.RI ( I )
followed by zero or more meta-IDs
.RI ( M )
surrounded by \f(CW\\xEE\f1 bytes
followed by the number of occurrences in the file
.RI ( O )
followed by a rank
.RI ( R ).
The
.I file-index
is an index into the \f(CWfile_offset\f1 table; the
.IR meta-IDs ,
if present,
are unique integers identifying which meta name(s) a word is associated with
in the meta-name index.
.SS Stop-Word Entries
Every stop-word entry in the
.I "stop-word index"
is of the form:
.cS
\f2stop-word\fP0
.cE
that is: every word is null-terminated.
.SS Directory Entries
Every directory entry in the
.I "directory index"
is of the form:
.cS
\f2directory-path\fP0
.cE
that is: a null-terminated full pathname of a directory
(not including the trailing slash).
The pathnames are relative to where the indexing was performed
(unless absolute paths were used).
.SS File Entries
Every file entry in the
.I "file index"
is of the form:
.cS
\f3\s+2{\s-2\fP\f2D\fP\f3\s+2}\s-2\fP\f2file-name\fP0\f3\s+2{\s-2\fP\f2S\fP\f3\s+2}{\s-2\fP\f2W\fP\f3\s+2}\s-2\fP\f2file-title\fP0
.cE
that is: the file's directory index
.RI ( D )
followed by a null-terminated file name
followed by the file's size in bytes
.RI ( S )
followed by the number of words in the file
.RI ( W )
followed by the file's null-terminated title.
.PP
For an HTML or XHTML file,
the title is what is between \f(CW<TITLE>\f1 ... \f(CW</TITLE>\f1 pairs.
For a mail or news file,
the title is the value of the \f(CWSubject\f1 header.
For a Unix manual page file,
the title is the contents of the first line within the \f(CWNAME\f1 section.
If a file is not one of those types of files, or is but does not have a title,
the title is simply the file (not path) name.
.SS Meta-Name Entries
Every meta-name entry in the
.I "meta-name index"
is of the form:
.cS
\f2meta-name\fP0\f3\s+2{\s-2\f2I\f3\s+2}\s-2\f(CW
.cE
that is: a null-terminated meta-name followed by the ID
.RI ( I ).
.SH CAVEATS
Generated index files are machine-dependent
(size of data types and byte-order).
