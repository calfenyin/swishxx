.SH DESCRIPTION
This package provides a utility functions for the World Wide Web
to extract descriptions of or meta information from files,
and hyperlink text.
.SH SUBROUTINES
The following Perl subroutines are defined and available:
.IP "\f(CWextract_description( \f2FILE\fP )\f1"
Extracts a description from an HTML or plain text file given by the
.I FILE
name;
.I FILE
should be an absolute path.
The first \f(CW$description::chars\f1 (default: 2048) characters are read.
If the file ends in one of the extensions
\f(CWhtm\f1, \f(CWhtml\f1, or \f(CWshtml\f1,
it is presumed to be an HTML file;
if the file ends in \f(CWtxt\f1, it is presumed to be a plain text file.
Other extensions are not recognized and no description is returned for them.
.IP ""
For HTML files, first,
if a \f(CW<META NAME="description" CONTENT="\f1...\f(CW">\f1
or a \f(CW<META NAME="DC.description" CONTENT="\f1...\f(CW">\f1
(Dublin Core) element is found,
then the words specified as the value of the \f(CWCONTENT\f1 attribute
is returned as the description.
.IP ""
Otherwise, all HTML comments, text between
\f(CW<SCRIPT>\f1, \f(CW<STYLE>\f1, and \f(CW<TITLE>\f1 tags,
and all other HTML tags are stripped.
If \f(CW<AREA\f1 ... \f(CWALT="\f1...\f(CW">\f1
or \f(CW<IMG\f1 ... \f(CWALT="...">\f1 elements are found,
then the words specified as the value of the \f(CWALT\f1 attributes
are extracted.
.IP  ""
Finally, for either HTML or plain text files,
at most \f(CW$description::words\fP (default: 50) are returned.
.IP "\f(CWextract_meta( \f2FILE\fP, \f2NAME\fP )\f1"
Extracts the value of the \f(CWCONTENT\f1 attribute from a \f(CWMETA\f1 element
having the given \f(CWNAME\f1 attribute
from an HTML file given by the
.I FILE
name;
.I FILE
should be an absolute path.
The file must end in one of the extensions
\f(CWhtm\f1, \f(CWhtml\f1, or \f(CWshtml\f1
to be considered an HTML file.
The first \f(CW$description::chars\f1 (default: 2048) characters are read.
The characters are cached between consecutive calls using the same filename.
.IP "\f(CWhyperlink( \f2LIST\fP )\f1"
Adds hyperlinks to strings:
that is strings that contain substrings that are valid URLs
(according to RFC 1630)
have the appropriate HTML tags ``wrapped'' around them so that they will be
selectable when displayed in a browser.
The \f(CWftp\f1, \f(CWgopher\f1, \f(CWhttp\f1, \f(CWhttps\f1, \f(CWmailto\f1,
\f(CWnews\f1, \f(CWtelnet\f1, and \f(CWwais\f1 URLs are recognized.
