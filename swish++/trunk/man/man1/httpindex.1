.SH NAME
httpindex \- HTTP front-end for SWISH++ indexer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wget
[
.I options
]
.I URL...
.B 2>&1 | httpindex
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B httpindex
is a front-end for
.BR index (1)
to index files copied from remote servers using
.BR wget (1).
The files (in a copy of the remote directory structure)
can be kept, deleted, or replaced with their descriptions after indexing.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS wget Options
The
.BR wget (1)
options that are
.B required
are:
.BR \-A ,
.BR \-nv ,
.BR \-r ,
and
.BR \-x ;
the ones that are
.B highly recommended
are:
.BR \-l ,
.BR \-nh ,
.BR \-t ,
and
.BR \-w .
(See the EXAMPLE.)
.SS httpindex Options
.B httpindex
accepts the same short options as
.BR index (1)
except for
.BR \-H ,
.BR \-I ,
.BR \-l ,
.BR \-r ,
.BR \-S ,
and
.BR \-V .
.PP
The following options are unique to
.BR httpindex :
.TP
.B \-d
Replace the text of local copies of retrieved files with their descriptions
after they have been indexed.
This is useful to display file descriptions in search results
without having to have complete copies of the remote files
thus saving filesystem space.
(See the \f(CWextract_description()\f1 function in
.BR WWW (3)
for details about how descriptions are extracted.)
.TP
.B \-D
Delete the local copies of retrieved files after they have been indexed.
This prevents your local filesystem from filling up
with copies of remote files.
.SH EXAMPLE
To index all HTML and text files on a remote web server
keeping descriptions locally:
.cS
wget -A html,txt -linf -t2 -rxnv -nh -w2 http://www.foo.com 2>&1 |
httpindex -d -e'html:*.html' -e'text:*.txt'
.cE
Note that you need to redirect
.BR wget (1)'s
output from standard error to standard output in order
to pipe it to
.BR httpindex .
.SH EXIT STATUS
Exits with a value of zero only if indexing completed sucessfully;
non-zero otherwise.
.SH CAVEATS & FILES
Same as those for
.BR index (1).
