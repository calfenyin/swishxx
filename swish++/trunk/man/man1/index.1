.SH NAME
index \- SWISH++ indexer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B index
[
.I options
]
.I directory...
.I file...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B index
is the SWISH++ file indexer.
It indexes the specified files
and files in the specified directories;
files in subdiretories of specified directories are also indexed by default
(unless either the
.B \-r
or
.B \-\-no-recurse
option or the
.B RecurseSubdirs
variable is given).
Files are indexed either only if their filename extension is among the set
specified with either the
.BR \-e ,
.BR \-\-extension ,
.BR \-h ,
or
.B \-\-html-extension
option or the
.B IncludeExtension
or
.B HTMLExtension
variables (unless standard input is used; see next paragraph)
or is not among the set specified with either the
.B \-E
or
.B \-\-no-extension
option or the
.B ExcludeExtension
variable.
.PP
If there is a single filename of `\f(CW-\f1', the list of directories and files
to index is instead taken from standard input (one per line).
In this case,
filename extensions of files to index need not be specified explicitly:
all files, regardless of extension
(unless it is among the set not to index specified with either the
.B \-E
or
.B \-\-no-extension
option or the
.B ExcludeExtension
variable), are indexed, i.e.,
.B index
assumes you know what you're doing when specifying filenames in this manner.
.PP
In any case, care must be taken not to specify files or subdirectories
in directories that are also specified:
since directories are recursively indexed by default (unless either the
.B \-r
or
.B \-\-no-recurse
option or the
.B RecurseSubdirs
variable is given),
explicitly specifying a subdirectory or file in a directory that is also
specified will result in those files being indexed more than once.
.SS Character Mapping
Characters in the ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1) character set
are mapped to their closest ASCII equivalent
before further examination and indexing.
.SS Character Entities
Both HTML character and numeric (decimal and hexadecimal) entity references
are converted to their ASCII character equivalents
before further examination and indexing.
For example, ``r&eacute;sum&#233;'' becomes ``resume'' before indexing.
.SS Word Determination
Stop words, words that occur too frequently or have no information content,
are not indexed.
(There is a default built-in set of a few hundred such words.)
Additionally, several heuristics are used to determine which words
should not be indexed.
.PP
First, a word is checked to see if it looks like an acronym.
A word is considered an acronym only if it starts with a capital letter and
is composed exclusively of capital letters, digits, and punctuation symbols,
e.g., ``AT&T.''
If a word looks like an acronym, it is indexed and no further checks are done.
.PP
Second, there are several other checks that are applied.
A word is not indexed if it:
.TP 4
1.
Starts with a capital letter, is of mixed case,
and contains more than a third capital letters, e.g., ``BizZARE.''
.TP
2.
Contains a capital letter other than the first, e.g, ``weIrd.''
.TP
3.
Is less than \f(CWWord_Min_Size\f1 letters.
(Default is 4.)
.TP
4.
Contains less than \f(CWWord_Min_Vowels\f1 vowels.
(Default is 1.)
.TP
5.
Contains more than \f(CWWord_Max_Consec_Same\f1 of the same character
consecutevely (not including digits).
(Default is 2.)
.TP
6.
Contains more than \f(CWWord_Max_Consec_Consonants\f1 consecutive consonants.
(Default is 5.)
.TP
7.
Contains more than \f(CWWord_Max_Consec_Vowels\f1 consecutive vowels.
(Default is 4.)
.TP
8.
Contains more than \f(CWWord_Max_Consec_Puncts\f1 consecutive punctuation
characters.
(Default is 1.)
.SS HTML Files
Additional processing is done for HTML files.
(HTML files are recognized as such only if their filename extension
is among the set specified via the
.B \-h
or
.B \-\-html-extension
option or the
.B HTMLExtension
variable.)
The additional processing is:
.TP 4
1.
If a matched set of \f(CW<TITLE>\f1 ... \f(CW</TITLE>\f1 tags is found
within the first \f(CWTitleLines\f1 lines of the file (default is 12),
then the text between the tags is stored in the generated index file as the
file's title rather than the file's name.
(Every non-space whitespace character in the title is converted to a space;
leading and trailing spaces are removed.)
.TP
2.
If an HTML element contains a \f(CWCLASS\f1 attribute whose value is among
the set of class names specified as those not to index (via one or more
of either the
.B \-C
or
.B \-\-no-class
option or the
.B ExcludeClass
variable),
then all the text up to the tag that ends the element will not be indexed.
.IP ""
For an element that has an optional end tag, ``the tag that ends the element''
is either the element's end tag or a tag of another element that implicitly
ends it;
for an element that does not have an end tag, ``the tag that ends the element''
is the element's start tag.
(See the EXAMPLES.)
All elements from the HTML 4.0 specification (including deprecated elements),
plus common, browser-specific elements are recognized;
unrecognized elements are ignored.
(See the
.B \-H
or
.B \-\-dump-html
option.)
.TP
3.
If an HTML element contains a \f(CWTITLE\f1 attribute,
then the words specified as the value of the \f(CWTITLE\f1 attribute
are indexed.
.TP
4.
If an \f(CWAREA\f1, \f(CWIMG\f1, or \f(CWINPUT\f1 element
contains an \f(CWALT\f1 attribute,
then the words specified as the value of the \f(CWALT\f1 attribute
are indexed.
.TP
5.
If a \f(CWMETA\f1 element contains both a \f(CWNAME\f1 and \f(CWCONTENT\f1
attribute, then the words specified
as the value of the \f(CWCONTENT\f1 attribute
are indexed associated with the meta name specified as the value of the
\f(CWNAME\f1 attribute.
(See also the
.BR \-m ,
.BR \-\-meta ,
.BR \-M ,
and
.B \-\-no-meta
option or the
.B IncludeClass
or
.B ExcludeClass
variables.)
Meta names can later be queried against specifically using
.BR search (1).
.TP
6.
If a \f(CWTABLE\f1 element contains a \f(CWSUMMARY\f1 attribute,
then the words specified as the value of the \f(CWSUMMARY\f1 attribute
are indexed.
.TP
7.
If an \f(CWOBJECT\f1 element contains a \f(CWSTANDBY\f1 attribute,
then the words specified as the value of the \f(CWSTANDBY\f1 attribute
are indexed.
.TP
8.
All other HTML tags and comments
(anything between \f(CW<\f1 and \f(CW>\f1 characters)
are discarded.
.PP
In compliance with the HTML specification,
any one of no quotes, single quotes, or double quotes may be used
to contain attribute values and attributes can appear in any order.
Values containing whitespace, however, must be quoted.
The specification is vague as to whether whitespace surrounding the \f(CW=\f1
is legal, but
.B index
allows it.
.SS Filters
Via the
.B FilterExtension
configuration file variable,
files having particular extensions can be filtered prior to indexing.
(See FILTERS in
.BR swish++.conf (4).)
.SH OPTIONS
Options begin with either a `\f(CW-\fP' for short options
or a ``\f(CW--\fP'' for long options.
A ``\f(CW--\fP'' by itself explicitly ends the options.
Either short or long options may be used.
Long option names may be abbreviated
so long as the abbreviation is unambiguous.
.PP
For a short option that takes an argument,
the argument is either taken to be the remaining characters of the same option,
if any, or, if not, is taken from the next option unless said option begins
with a `\f(CW-\fP'.
.PP
Short options that take no arguments can be grouped
(but the last option in the group can take an argument), e.g.,
\f(CW-lrv4\fP
is equivalent to
\f(CW-l -r -v4\fP.
.PP
For a long option that takes an argument,
the argument is either taken to be the characters after a `\f(CW=\fP', if any,
or, if not, is taken from the next option unless said option begins with
a `\f(CW-\fP'.
.TP 20

A configuration file is not required:
if none is specified and the default does not exist, none is used;
however, if one is specified and it does not exist, then this is an error.
.TP

(Default is not to follow them.)
This option is not available under Microsoft Windows
since it doesn't support symbolic links.
.TP
.BI \-m m
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI \-\-meta= m
For HTML files only, the value of a meta \f(CWNAME\f1 attribute,
.IR m ,
for which the words in the value of the associated \f(CWCONTENT\f1 attribute
should be indexed.
Case is irrelevant.
Multiple
.B \-m
or
.B \-\-meta
options may be specified.
.IP ""
By default, words in the value of the \f(CWCONTENT\f1 attribute
for all meta names are indexed.
Specifying at least one meta name via this option changes that
so that only the words in the value of the \f(CWCONTENT\f1 attribute
associated with a member of the set of meta names
explicitly specified via one or more
.B \-m
or
.B \-\-meta
options are indexed.
.TP

If you want to keep all words regardless, specify 101.
.TP
.B \-r
.br
.ns
.TP
.B \-\-no-recurse
Do not recursively index the files in subdirectories,
that is: when a directory is encountered,
all the files in that directory are indexed
(modulo the filename extensions specified via either the
.BR \-e ,
.BR \-\-extension ,
.BR \-h ,
.BR \-\-html-extension ,
.BR \-E ,
or
.B \-\-no-extension
options or the
.BR IncludeExtension ,
.BR HTMLExtension ,
or
.B ExcludeExtension
variables) but subdirectories encountered are ignored
and therefore the files contained in them are not indexed.
This option is most useful when specifying the directories and files to index
via standard input.
(Default is to index the files in subdirectories recursively.)
.TP
.BI \-s f
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI \-\-stop-file= f
The name of a file,
.IR f ,
containing the set of stop-words to use instead of the built-in set.

.BI \-\-title-lines= n
For HTML files only, the maximum number of lines,
.IR n ,
into a file to look at for HTML \f(CW<TITLE>\f1 tags.

Larger numbers slow indexing.
.TP
.BI \-T d
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI \-\-temp-dir= d
The path of the directory,
.IR d ,
to use for temporary files.
The directory must exist.
(Default is \f(CW/tmp\f1.)
.IP ""
If your OS mounts swap space on \f(CW/tmp\f1,
as indexing progresses and more files get created in \f(CW/tmp\f1,
you will have less swap space, indexing will get slower,
and you may run out of memory.
If this is the case, you can specify a directory on a real filesystem, i.e.,
one on a physical disk.
.TP
.BI \-v n
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI \-\-verbosity= n

To index all HTML and text files on a web server:
.cS
cd /home/www/htdocs
index -v3 -h html -h shtml -e txt .
.cE

.SS Using \f(CWCLASS\fP Attributes to Index Selectively
In an HTML document, there may be sections that should not be indexed.
For example, if every page of a web site contains a navigation menu such as:
.cS
<SELECT NAME="menu">
<OPTION>Home
<OPTION>Automotive
<OPTION>Clothing
<OPTION>Hardware
</SELECT>
.cE
or a common header and footer, then, ordinarily,
those words would be indexed for every page and therefore be discarded
because they would be too frequent.
However, via either the
.B \-C
or
.B \-\-no-class
option or the
.B ExcludeClass
variable, one or more class names can be specified and then HTML elements
belonging to one of those classes will not have the text
up to the tag that ends them indexed.
Given a class name of, say, \f(CWno_index\f1, the above menu can be changed to:
.cS
<SELECT NAME="menu" CLASS="no_index">
.cE
and then everything up to the \f(CW</SELECT>\f1 tag will not be indexed.
.PP
For an HTML element that has an optional end tag
(such as the \f(CW<P>\f1 element),
the text up to the tag that ends it will not be indexed,
which is either the element's own end tag
or a tag of some other element that implicitly ends it.
For example, in:
.cS
<P CLASS="no_index">
This was the poem that Alice read:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Jabberwocky</B><BR>
`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<BR>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<BR>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<BR>
And the mome raths outgrabe.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
.cE
the \f(CW<BLOCKQUOTE>\f1 tag implicitly ends the \f(CW<P>\f1 element
(as do all block-level elements)
so the only text that is not indexed above is:
``This was the poem that Alice read.''
.PP
For an HTML element that does not have an end tag,
only the text within the start tag will not be indexed.
For example, in:
.cS
<IMG SRC="home.gif" ALT="Home" CLASS="no_index">
.cE
the word ``Home'' will not be indexed even though it ordinarily would have been
if the \f(CWCLASS\f1 attribute were not there.
