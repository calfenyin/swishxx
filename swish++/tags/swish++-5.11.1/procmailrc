##
# Pick a directory into which individual mail messages will be split and create
# it if it doesn't already exist.
#
# If you subscribe to a mailing list and you want to split mail into a separate
# directory, replace "split" below with the mailing list name.
##
SPLIT_MAIL_DIR=$HOME/mail/split/`date +%Y/%m`
JUNK=`test -d $SPLIT_MAIL_DIR || mkdir -p $SPLIT_MAIL_DIR`

##
# Copy the current mail message to the split mail directory; the original will
# continue on its way to be processed by later recipies, if any.
#
# If you subscribe to a mailing list and you want to split mail into a separate
# directory, insert a line like "* ^TOlist-name" between the two lines below.

# If you want to split multiple mailing lists, then you need to repeat the
# above four (non-commentary) lines once per list (changing the list name, of
# course).
