#	SWISH++
#	swish++.conf
#
#	This is a template configuration file.  It contains every
#	configuration variable, lists which executable(s) it's used with, and
#	gives a brief explanation.  Use this as a starting point for your own
#	configuration file.
#
#	Notes:
#	------
#
#	1. Sets of values are separated by whitespace.
#
#	2. The same variable may be specified on more than one line.  For sets,
#	   the value is the union of all the values; for all others, the value
#	   is the last value specified.
#
#	3. There is a special "infinity" numeric value.
#
#	4. Boolean values are one of: true, t, false, f, yes, y, no, n.  Case
#	   is irrelevant.
#
#	5. COMMENTS ARE TREATED AS SUCH ONLY IF THEY ARE ON LINES BY
#	   THEMSELVES!
##

#ExcludeClass		no_index
#
# used by: index; same as -C option.
#
#	For HTML files only, a set of class names of HTML elements whose text
#	is not to be indexed.

IncludeExtension	html txt
#
# used by: index, extract; same as -e option.
#
#	A set of filename extensions (without the dots) of files to index.
#	Case is significant.  You normally specify either IncludeExtension or
#	ExcludeExtension (whichever is easier to specify), but not both.

#ExcludeExtension	gif jpg
#
# used by: index, extract; same as -E option.
#
#	A set of filename extensions (without the dots) of files not to index.
#	Case is significant.  You normally specify either IncludeExtension or
#	ExcludeExtension (whichever is easier to specify), but not both.

#IncludeMeta		meta1 meta2 metaN
#
# used by: index; same as -m option.
#
#	For HTML files only, the value of meta NAME attributes for which the
#	words in the value of the associated CONTENT attribute should be
#	indexed.  Case is irrelevant.  You normally specify either IncludeMeta
#	or ExcludeMeta (whichever is easier to specify), but not both.
#	
#	By default, words in the value of the CONTENT attribute for all meta
#	names are indexed.  Specifying at least one meta name via this variable
#	changes that so that only the words in the value of the CONTENT
#	attribute associated with a member of the set of meta names explicitly
#	specified are indexed.

#ExcludeMeta		meta8 meta9 metaM
#
# used by: index; same as -M option.
#
#	For HTML files only, the value of meta NAME attributes for which the
#	words in the value of the associated CONTENT attribute should not be
#	indexed.  Case is irrelevant.  You normally specify either IncludeMeta
#	or ExcludeMeta (whichever is easier to specify), but not both.

#FilterExtension gz	gunzip -c %f > @E
#FilterExtension Z	uncompress -c %f > @E
#FilterExtension pdf	pdftotext %f @E.txt
#
# used by: index, extract; no option equivalent.
#
#	Filter files having certain extensions prior to either indexing or
#	extraction.

IndexFile		swish++.index
#
# used by: index, search; same as -i option.
#
#	The name of the index file either generated or searched.
#

RecurseSubdirs		yes
#
# used by: index, extract; when "no", same as -r option.
#
#	Recursively index the files in subdirectories, that is: when a
#	directory is encountered, all the files in that directory are indexed
#	(modulo the filename extensions specified via the IncludeExtension or
#	ExcludeExtension variables), but subdirectories encountered are
#	ignored and therefore the files contained in them are not indexed.
#	(This option is most useful when specifying the directories and files
#	to index via standard input.)  The default is to index the files in
#	subdirectories recursively.

ResultsMax		100
#
# used by: search; same as -m option.
#
#	The maximum number of results to return overriding the compiled-in
#	default (which is usually 100).

StemWords		no
#
# used by: search; when "yes", same as -s option.
#
#	Perform stemming (suffix stripping) on words during searches.  Words
#	that end in the wildcard character are not stemmed.

#StopWordFile		custom_stop_word_file
#
# used by: index, extract; same as -s option.
#
#	The name of a file containing the set of stop-words to use instead of
#	the built-in set.

TempDirectory		/tmp
#
# used by: index
#
#	Directory to use for temporary files during indexing.  If your OS
#	mounts swap space on /tmp, as indexing progresses and more files get
#	created in /tmp, you will have less swap space, indexing will get
#	slower, and you may run out of memory.  If this is the case, you can
#	specify a directory on a real filesystem, i.e., one on a physical
#	disk.  The directory must exist.

TitleLines		12
#
# used by: index; same as -t option.
#
#	For HTML files only, the maximum number of lines into a file to look
#	at for HTML <TITLE> tags.  The default is 12.  Larger numbers slow
#	indexing.

Verbosity		0
#
# used by: index, extract; save as the -v option.
#
#	Print additional information to standard output during indexing.  The
#	verbosity levels, 0-4; see index(1) or extract(1) for details.

WordFilesMax		infinity
#
# used by: index; same as -f option.
#
#	The maximum number of files a word may occur in before it is discarded
#	as being too frequent.  The default is infinity.

WordPercentMax		100
#
# used by: index; same as -p option.
#
#	The maximum percentage of files a word may occur in before it is
#	discarded as being too frequent.  The default is 100.  If you want to
#	keep all words regardless, specify 101.
