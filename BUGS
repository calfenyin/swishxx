# SWISH++: Simple Web Indexing System for Humans: C++ version

## What to do if you find a bug

In the hopefully rare circumstance that you find a bug, first ensure you are
running the latest version of SWISH++ since the bug may have already been
fixed.

If you are running the latest version of SWISH++ and there is still a bug,
please report it to me by e-mail: <paul@lucasmail.org>.  Please include the
following information:

1. A description of the problem.
2. The operating system and version.
3. The exact command line used.
4. The configuration file used, if any.
5. If the bug is with the indexer, the single file that causes the bug to
   manifest.
6. If the command dumps core, a stack trace.

To get a stack trace:

7. You should have a "core" file (if the filesystem is writable and you have
   write permission to it).  For Mac OS X, core files are placed in the
   directory /cores and are of the form "core.XXXXX" where XXXXX is the process
   ID.

   If you can write to the filesystem yet no core file was generated, type:

	ulimit -c unlimited

   and try again.

8. Execute gdb by typing:

	gdb /path/to/swish++-executable /path/to/core

9. Then in gdb, type "where" and copy and paste the output into an e-mail
   message to me.
