* Changes in SWISH++ 7.0

** Now using Autoconf & Automake.
The autoconf & automake are now being used for SWISH++ configuration
and compilation.

** Added a test suite.
Doing a "make check" will now run a suite of tests to ensure SWISH++ is
producing correct results.

** Added HTML5 elements to HTML indexer.
SWISH++ now does a better job of indexing HTML5 markup.

** Improved RTF indexer.
SWISH++ now extracts the \title from RTF files and associates words in
Information Groups as meta names.

** Can now change directories just prior to indexing.
The index command now accepts a new -d command-line option or a new
ChangeDirectory configuration variable to change directories just prior to
indexing.

** Now using C++11.
Now using C++11 as the minimum required C++ version.

** Added Python documentation.
Wherever the documentaion gives Perl 5 examples now also gives Python examples.

* Changes in SWISH++ 6.1.4

** Fixed indexing of ID3 tags.
Indexing of some ID3 ags was broken; now fixed.

* Changes in SWISH++ 6.1.3

** Fixed the search -d option.
It simply didn't work; it now does.

* Changes in SWISH++ 6.1.2

** Fixed indexing of LaTeX files ending in '%'.
The core dump that resulting from indexing a LaTeX file ending in '%' (with no
newline) has been fixed.

* Changes in SWISH++ 6.1

** Added launchd(8) cooperation.
On Mac OS X systems, the search daemon can now be controlled by launchd(8).

* Changes in SWISH++ 6.0

** Added "near" searches.
Added the ability to search using "near" in queries.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.15.4

** Fixed extraction from standard input.
The extract command has been fixed to work from standard input.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.15.2

** Fixed search results.
Search results didn't include the last one, i.e., if there are supposed to be N
results, only N-1 were returned.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.15

** Index file size reduction.
Numbers stored in generated index files are now more highly compressed
resulting in an overall average savings of approximately 6% in index size.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.14.2

** Fixed escaping of shell meta-characters.
Passing filenames containing shell meta-characters to the shell for filtering
is now fixed.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.14

** Added chkconfig support.
The searchd script now supports chkconfig.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.13.4

** Fixed the search --max-results option.
The search command --max-results now actually includes the "max" part.

* Changes SWISH++ 5.13

** Added ID3 indexing.
Added an indexing module for ID3 tags (typically found inside MP3 files).
ID3v1.x and ID3v2.x through 2.4.0 are supported (with the exception of
encrypted frames).

** Added UTF-16 support.
Added support for decoding UTF-16 text (both big- and little-endian).

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.12.1

** Fixed negative ranks.
File ranks are no longer ever negative.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.12

** Run-time setting of WordThreshold.
The WordThreshold parameter may now be set either in a config. file or on the
command line (as opposed to being only a compiled-in constant).  However, only
the super-user may specify a value larger than the default.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.11.1

** Fixed handling of invalid UTF-8.
Invalid UTF-8 byte sequences are now handled better.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.11

** Improved rank results.
The ranking result numbers (1-100) have been significantly improved: they are
much less striated now.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.10

** Improved XHTML indexing.
Added some XHTML 2.0 elements.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.9.6

** Improved LaTeX indexing.
Unknown LaTeX commands are now ignored (as they should have been) rather than
indexed.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.9.4

** Improved FreeBSD support.
The core dumps for the search command under FreeBSD have been fixed.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.9

** Improved XML search results.
Added XML schema information in search results XML output.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.8

** Added UTF-8 and UTF-8 support.
Added the ability to decode UTF-7 and UTF-8 in mail/news messages.

** Improved "not" in queries.
Changed the query grammar to allow "not meta" rather than just "not primary".
(What this means is that, previously "not foo = bar" wasn't legal even though
it should have been.  Instead, you had to do "not (foo = bar)".)

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.7.1

** Fixed zero rank.
Ranks were sometimes printed as zero; this has been fixed.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.7

** Added LaTex support.
LaTeX files can now be indexed directly.

** Document title whitespace improvement.
Document titles now have multiple whitespace characters squeezed into single
whitespace characters.

** Added TMPDIR support.
The index command will now use the value of the environment variable TMPDIR if
it's set as the default temporary directory.  However, the value is still
superseded by one of -T, --temp-dir, or TempDirectory if given.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.6

** Added direct RTF support.
The text/enriched attachment indexer that was part of the Mail module was split
off into its own RTF (Rich Text Format) module so stand-alone RTF files can now
be indexed.

** Reseting TCP connections.
For the search command running as a daemon, added code to reset the TCP
connection for bad requests.  (The reason for doing this is so we don't
potentially have a socket lingering in TIME-WAIT from a client that was too
dumb to give us a valid request in the first place.  This helps alleviate
denial-of-service attacks (if that's what's going on).)

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.5.3

** Added Procmail script.
A sample Procmail recipe has been added that can be used to split incoming mail
messages into individual files for indexing.

** Improved word-determination heuristics.
Camel-case words like "FedEx" and "iMac" are now indexed.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.5

** Added non-auto-background daemon support.
The search command can now be run as a daemon without it automatically putting
itself into the background.  This is useful in order to wrap a start script
around it and automatically restart it if it dies for any reason.

** Added search scripts.
Added two new utility scripts: searchmonitor (a process monitor for search) and
searchd (a start/stop script for SysV-like systems).

** Improved super-user security.
The search command, when run as a daemon, can now give away its root privileges
if it started with them.  There are new command-line options of -U, --user, -G,
and --group as well as new configuration variables User and Group.

** Improved support for very large document sets.
Very large document sets where many partial indicies are generated (more than
the maximum number of open file descriptors) are now supported.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.4

** Added XML search results.
Search results can now optionally be output in XML.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.3

** Improved queries containing multiple "and" terms.
The weighting of multiple "and" terms has been improved.  Previously, the query
"mouse and computer and keyboard" was parsed and treated as "(mouse and
computer) and keyboard" where "mouse" and "computer" each got 25% and
"keyboard" got 50% of the weighting.  (The last term always got 50% of the
weightings.)  The weighting is now distributed evenly.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.2

** Support for filtering e-mail attachment.
E-mail attachments can now be filtered by external programs.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.1

* Reduced index file size.
Reduced index storage size by recording directory names only once.
Correspondingly, the old -G option for the index command has changed to -g and
there is a new -G option.

* Changes in SWISH++ 5.0

** Mail and News filter added.
A filter module for mail (and news) files has been added.

** Manual page filter added.
A filter module for manual page files has been added.

** Added a filename substitution for filters.
Added a new %E (second-to-last filename extenstion) substitution.

** Added ability not to associate meta-data.
For the index command, a new -A or --no-assoc-meta option and AssociateMeta
configuration variable have been added.

** Added TCP socket support.
The search daemon can now answer queries via TCP sockets in addition to Unix
domain sockets.

** Added custom results separator.
You can now specify the separator string in search results via the new -R or
--separator command-line options or the new ResultSeparator configuration file
variable.

** Added XHTML 1.1 Ruby element support.
Added parsing of XHTML 1.1 ruby elements.

* Changes in SWISH++ 4.7

** Added filter basename substitutions.
Added 'b' and 'B' substitutions for filters that are the base name and base
name minus the extension of a file name, respectively.  (This is useful when
you need the temporary files created in a location other than where the
originals are, for example when the originals are on a filesystem that you
don't have write access to.)

** Renamed 'E' substitution to 'F'.
For consistency, the 'E' substitution has been renamed to 'F'.

* Changes in SWISH++ 4.6.6

** Improved long-tag-name handling.
Fixed segmentation fault when parsing HTML files that contain tags longer than
Tag_Name_Max_Size characters.

* Changes in SWISH++ 4.6.4

** Improved long-pathname support.
File having path names longer than 255 characters are now indexed properly.

* Changes in SWISH++ 4.6.3

** Improved HTML <dd> element support.
Fixed the handling of <dd> elements by now implicitly terminating them by a
<dt> element.

* Changes in SWISH++ 4.6

** Added custom extract extensions.
Added the ability to specify the extension appended to files for the extract
command.

** Added extract filter support.
Added the ability to run the extract command as a filter.

* Changes in SWISH++ 4.5

** Added full filename pattern support.
Added the ability to index, not index, and filter files based on filename
pattern rather than merely extension.

* Changes in SWISH++ 4.4

** Added literal '%' and '@' filter support.
The FilterExtension variable now allows you to specify literal '%' and '@'
characters by simply doubling the character.

* Changes in SWISH++ 4.3

** Added process ID file support.
The search command has a new -P and --pid-file options and a PidFile
configuration variable to specify a file to write its process ID when running
as a daemon.

* Changes in SWISH++ 4.2

** Added incremental indexing support.
You can now index incrementally by adding new files to an existing index via
the -I or --incremental command-line options or Incremental configuration file
variable.

* Changes in SWISH++ 4.1

** Reduced index file size.
Generated index files are now approximately 24% smaller.

* Changes in SWISH++ 4.0

** Added search daemon support.
The search command now has the ability to run in the background as a
multi-threaded daemon process functioning as a search server.

* Changes in SWISH++ 3.1

** Added long-option support.
All executables now accept alternate long ("GNU-style") command-line options.

** Added -? option.
Added the -? option to print the usage ("help") message.

** Added custom HTML filename extension support.
Added a new -h option and HTMLExtention configuration variable to allow
filename extensions that are to be treated as HTML to be specified.

** Added zero results support.
The search command now allows max-results to be specified as 0.  (This allows
the -R option to be eliminated.)

** Added ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1) support.
Added code to map ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1) characters to their closest ASCII
equivalent so that they are treated eactly like character entity references.
(This should also improve use of SWISH++ in other languages.)

* Changes in SWISH++ 3.0.3

** Added -H option.
A -H option has been added to the index command to dump the built-in set of
recognized HTML elements to standard output (so you can check to see if a
certain element is recognized or not).

** Improved Boolean configuration file variable value support.
Boolean configuration file variables now accept "on" and "off" values.

* Changes in SWISH++ 3.0

** Added file filtering.
The index and extract commands now allow flexible file filtering.

** Added configuration file support.
SWISH++ now supports configuration files.

** Added -T option.
The index command now accepts a -T option that allows the directory to use for
temporary files to be specified.

** Added "examined" statistics.
The index and extract commands now report the number of files examined in
addition to the number indexed or extracted, respectively.

* Changes in SWISH++ 2.0.1

** Improved HTML support.
HTML addtributes inside HTML comments and DOCTYPE declarations are no longer
parsed.

* Changes in SWISH++ 2.0

** Added selective non-indexing for HTML files.
The index command can now selectively not index text in HTML files within HTML
elements that are members of specified classes.

** Added stemming support.
The search command now offers optional stemming.

** Added search result count.
The search command now outputs an additional comment "results" followed by the
total number of search results.  Additionally, there is a new -R command-line
option to print this alone.

* Changes in SWISH++ 1.7

** Added support for more HTML attributes to index.
The complete list is now "title" (for any element), "alt" (for the "area",
"img", and "input" elements), "standby" (for the "object" element), and
"summary" (for the "table" element).

* Changes in SWISH++ 1.6

** Improved "content" attribute support.
The value of the "content" attribute for "meta" elements can now selectively be
indexed based on the value of the "name" attribute, either by explicit
inclusion or exclusion.

** Fixed parentheses support in queries.
Fixed parentheses use in conjunction with 'not' in a query involving meta
names, e.g., "search author = not ( hawking )".

* Changes in SWISH++ 1.5.1

** Added verbosity level 4.
Both the index and extract commands now have a new verbosity level 4 that
prints filenames that are not indexed or extracted, respectively, and why.

* Changes in SWISH++ 1.5

** Added httpindex script.
A new command, httpindex, has been added to assist in indexing files on remote
servers.

* Changes in SWISH++ 1.4.1

** Added multiple meta-names support.
A given word can now be associated with multiple meta-names per file.

* Changes in SWISH++ 1.4

** Added "meta" support.
The index command now indexes the contents of "meta" HTML elements.

** Added "alt" support.
The index command now indexes the content of "alt" attributes within "area" and
"img" HTML elements.

** Added standard input support.
The index command can now index files and directories specified via standard
input instead of via the command line.

** Added recursion suppression.
The index and extract commands now support a new -r command line option to
suppress recursively indexing files in subdirectories.

* Changes in SWISH++ 1.3.2

** Fixed the -S option.
Fixed the index -S option.

* Changes in SWISH++ 1.3

** Added search query words window.
The search command can now dump a "window" of words around the query words via
the new -w option.

** Improved search -d option.
The search command's -d option now dumps all the query words instead of a
single word.  Additionally, a stop-word used to print "stop-word"; now it
prints "# ignored: " followed by the word.  Lastly, the -d option now prints
the commend "not found: word" if "word" is not found in the index.

* Changes in SWISH++ 1.2.2

** Improved word-determination heuristics.
A heuristic was added not to index a word if it contains more than a
threshold number of consecutive punctuation characters.

** Index exclusion.
Files can now be indexed by exclusion of filename extensions rather than by
inclusion via a new -E command-line option.

* Changes in SWISH++ 1.2.1

** New -d and -D options.
The search command's original -d option that used to dump the entire index now
dumps the index entry for a single word.  Correspondingly, a new -D option now
does what -d used to do.

** Rank inclusion in dump.
The search command now includes index entry's ranks in its dump.

** Added HTML numeric entity reference support.
Numeric HTML entity references are now converted to their ASCII equivalents.

* Changes in SWISH++ 1.2

** Improved stop-word support during searches.
SWISH++ now stores the list of stop-words in the generated index file so they
can be ignored on searches later.

** Added -F option.
A new -F command-line option allows the number of files to reserve space for to be specified.

** Added -t option.
A new -t command-line option allows the number of lines to look into a file for
an HTML <title> element to be specified.

* Changes in SWISH++ 1.1

** Dump default stop words.
The index command can now dump the built-in default set of stop-words to a file
to edit and then use to index.

** Example Perl code.
Some example Perl 5 code for interfacing SWISH++ to a web-based search form has
been provided.

* Changes in SWISH++ 1.1b2

** Better truncated long titles.
For HTML files having titles longer than Title_Max_Size in length, the last
three characters are replaces by an ellipsis ("...").

* Changes in SWISH++ 1.1b1

** Can now skip search results.
The search command has a new -s option to specify the number of initial results
to skip.  Used in conjuntion with -m, results can be returned in "pages."
